# .config file

My basic config for tmux, nvim, and my terminal of choice alacritty

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vivindeena/config/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
```

TODO's
- [ ] Move Keybindings from old config to nvChad
- [ ] Copy over missing plugins, like harpoon, and notify(notify has nvchad support check what to do with that )
